      <p>Hi All. My name is Sergio. I've created this site to have my own little place on the web.</p>

      <p>I grew up in McAllen until I left to Boston for college (at <a href="http://mit.edu">MIT</a>). After four long but great years I joined the working world accepting an offer at <a href="http://quickbase.intuit.com">Intuit QuickBase</a>. Not long after, I left Boston to move to Seattle.</p>

      <p>I'm a tech geek at heart but I also enjoy cooking, movies, books (supporting my local library), and video games (I like games that allow 4 players on one console, none of that online stuff).</p>

      <p>Checkout my <a href="http://hungrybear.org/my-stuff/projects/">projects</a> to see what sort of stuff I've worked</p>
