This year we decided to join our friends at the Washington Yacht Club on their yearly camping/sailing trip. This year the trip was to Blake Island, a small island in the Puget Sound overlooking Seattle.

The trip started at the University of Washinton and we made our way through the canal out to Puget Sound. Making our way through the canal we encountered a school of salmon making their way in the opposite direction. They were quite large and occasionaly would jump out of the water. We were suprised to learn that salmon jump.

Once we made it to the Sound, we slowly sailed to Blake Island, taking a couple hours. Once there, we had a salmon bake/steak grilling party for dinner before putting up our tents for the night. The next morning, after a small breakfast we headed back home.
