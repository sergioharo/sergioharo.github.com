For Easter this year, we decide to throw a little shinding together. We had been staring at the fried chicken in Thomas Keller's Ad Hoc for over a year now. We decided Easter would be the perfect time to make it.

Making the chicken is a two-day affair which starts with an overnight brine. You can probably find the recipe around the web, but I recommend picking up a copy of Ad Hoc, there are some great recipes in there.

Overall, the chicken was a resounding success. It was the second best fried chicken I've ever had, second only to the [Screen Door](http://screendoorrestaurant.com) in Portland.
