Ever since going to Spur Gastropub, we've been exposed to the wonders if the salmon crostini. Tonight we had some leftover salmon so we decided to try our hand at creating our own.

Our crostini was composed with a ritz cracker base. This was followed be a dollop of parsnip puree and sour cream. Then came the salmon which was topped with pickled red onion and habenero salsa. It was garnished with a bit of dill, extra virgin olive oil, and salt.
