We just received our custom designed letterpressed wedding invitations. They were designed and printed by Julie Cook at [Swash Press](http://www.swashpress.com).

Julie did an amazing job and we're really happy at how everything came out. She took our original "Save the Date" design and refined it to look simpler and cleaner.
