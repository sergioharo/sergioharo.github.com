The month of May started out fairly well in Seattle. It was sunny and warm early on. But as the month progressed it slowly turned into a fairly cloudly month. We decided to break the monotony and road trip down to portland for the weekend. Much to our chagrin we found just more cloudly weather.

It was actually a fun trip with lots of eating. We left early Saturday morning and started our day at the Portland Saturday Market. Nothing really caught our eye until we started seeing the bright pink boxes of the legendary Voodoo Donut. We followed the boxes until we came upon their original location. The line was ridiciously long but hey, what are you going to do. I was expecting cakey doughnuts but they are actually fairly fluffy. Not Krispy Kreme fluffy but still quite good.

After that snack we went in search of more food. Unlike Seattle, food stalls are all over Portland. Its actually pretty awesome, just a full block of stalls. Once we got our fix, we meandered down to Powell's Books. Its a book store if you couldn't tell, but it has more books than almost any library. Its also a giant place which is hard to grok from the outside. It's kinda of like the Tardis, bigger on the inside than the outside.

We could have spent many more hours at Powell's but we had to continue on our day. The next stop was at [Smith's Tea Shop](http://www.smithtea.com). Julie's slowly becoming a tea connoisseur so I thought she might enjoy the place. I was expecting more of a loose leaf store but its actually more of a coffee shop. Julie and Christine shared a tea tasting while I got a matcha latte. The latte was quite delicious. Somehow they turned all the milk into a foamy substance that was rich but light at the same time. The people in the store where incredibly helpful and patient as Julie and Christine tried to decide what their tasting should consist of.

The day ended at the [Screen Door](http://screendoorrestaurant.com), which has what we think is the best fried chicken that we've had so far. With that we were out for the day. Note, on the screen door. The chicken tastes almost as good cold as it does fresh.

The next morning, we got some bikes on loan from the hotel we were staying at. It was near the airport so we rode on a bike trail the runs alongside the Columbia River. The only issue was that they only had cruiser bikes which were gigantic. As you peddled, your legs would fully extend on every revolution. This made biking incredibly tiring, but at least it wasn't as hilly as Seattle. Once we worked up an appetite, we made our way to the [Waffle Window](http://wafflewindow.com). Its literally a whole in the wall that serves up Belgian waffles topped with all sorts of breakfasty items.

We ended our trip we a visit to [OMSI](https://www.omsi.edu). The mueseum was pretty great. Lots of interactive exhibits where you got to test all sorts of things. We even found out that Julie has crazy grip strength, so much that she almost went out of the scale. We also got to tour around an old diesel submarine and look through the periscope. With that, we hit the road and made our way back home.
