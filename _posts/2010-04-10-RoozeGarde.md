If you're ever in Seattle in the spring, one thing you should try to do is visit the tulip fields up in Skagit county. It's about an hour and a half north of Seattle. Every April-May the tulip fields come into bloom with large fields of different colors. It's quite an impressive sight. There are a couple of farms in the area, but the one we end up going to is RoozenGarde.
