During Julie's thesis defense, we ended up having both of our families visit. We wanted our parents to get a little bit of exercise so we looked for a nice hike for them. We settled on [Lake Serene](http://www.wta.org/go-hiking/hikes/lake-serene). We thought it wouldn't be too bad. However, it was a bit more difficult than we had anticipated. We ended up tiring out both sets of parents by the end of the trip. The view at the top is great though. Although I don't know if the parents would agree if it was worth it.
